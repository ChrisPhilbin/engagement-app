# About EngagePro

This project was inspirated by my previous management experience, combined with 8+ years in the HCM SaaS space in which the growing trend is for enabling organizations to move their employee engagement scores in a positive direction in an effort to reduce turnover, promote a sense of beloning/inclusion, and ultimately drive an ROI to the bottom line.

Specifically, this app allows managers and business unit leaders to keep track of their direct reports and keep track of the last time they had a meaningful interaction with each, as well as keep track of things like their interests outside of work, birthdays, work anniversaries, meetings, and agreed upon deliverables discussed in each meeting.
